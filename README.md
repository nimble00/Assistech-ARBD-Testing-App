Project for COP315.
This repository contains all the versions of the app(except GUI) created until now.
The app with complete GUI linked is in another repo, visit: https://bitbucket.org/sudhi_p/arbd-testing-app/src/master/
A blog where I discuss the journey from scratch to the final application, there's a also a video demonstrating the working app: https://nimble00.wordpress.com/2018/04/30/project-automated-testing-of-rbd/
